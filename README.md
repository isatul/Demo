This an analysis I embarked upon to showcase the effect of the Corona Virus (COVID-19) pandemic in Nigeria.
Taking into consideration, the Total cases recorded, the number of recovered cases, total deaths, ratio of male to female cases, state spread amongst others.
This does not in anyway give a complete insight into the pandemic but an overview of what you could get if you choose to work with me. 
I guarantee a neat and easily understandable report for you.
